**Introduction:**

This README provides an overview of the API and instructions on how to query its endpoints using Python.

**API Overview:**

The API provides access to [Insert Brief Description of the API Here]. It allows users to [Insert Main Functionality of the API Here].

**Endpoints:**

   - URL: `/endpoint1`
   - Method: GET
   - Parameters: [List of Parameters]
   - Description: [Description of Endpoint 1]

2. **Endpoint 2:** [Description of Endpoint 2]
   - URL: `/endpoint2`
   - Method: POST
   - Parameters: [List of Parameters]
   - Description: [Description of Endpoint 2]

**How to Query API Endpoint with Python:**

To query the API endpoint using Python, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Packages:**
   Make sure you have the necessary packages installed. You can install them using pip:

   ```
   pip install requests
   ```

2. **Import Requests Module:**
   Import the requests module in your Python script:

   ```python
   import requests
   ```

3. **Send GET Request:**
   Use the `requests.get()` method to send a GET request to the desired API endpoint:

   ```python
   url = "API_ENDPOINT_URL"
   response = requests.get(url)
   ```

4. **Send POST Request:**
   Use the `requests.post()` method to send a POST request to the desired API endpoint:

   ```python
   url = "API_ENDPOINT_URL"
   payload = {"key": "value"}
   response = requests.post(url, data=payload)
   ```

5. **Handle Response:**
   You can then handle the response returned by the API:

   ```python
   if response.status_code == 200:
       data = response.json()
       # Process the data
   else:
       print("Error:", response.status_code)
   ```

**Example:**

Here's a simple example of querying the API endpoint:

```python
import requests

url = "API_ENDPOINT_URL"
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code)
```

Replace `"API_ENDPOINT_URL"` with the actual URL of the API endpoint you want to query.
