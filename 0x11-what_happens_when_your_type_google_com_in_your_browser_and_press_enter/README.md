5. **Load-Balancer:** Digital traffic directors known as load balancers distribute incoming requests across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization and improve response times.
   
6. **Web Server:** The web server hosts the website's files and responds to requests from clients, generating appropriate responses such as HTML documents containing webpage content.
   
7. **Application Server:** This server executes server-side code, retrieves data from databases, and generates dynamic content tailored to users' needs, especially in dynamic websites or web applications.
   
8. **Database:** Google relies on a network of databases to store and retrieve information swiftly in response to user requests, completing the journey through the digital realm.
